# ps4-overlay
Finally, a Gentoo PS4 overlay that is up-to-date and has all the packages a PS4 Linux repository should. (At least, that's the plan. Still a WIP)

xf86-video-amdgpu-21.0.0 & 9999  
xf86-video-ati-19.1.0 & 9999  
libdrm-2.4.107 & 9999  
mesa-21.2.2 && 9999

## TODO:
ps4-linux-5.3.7 (the PS4Gentoo kernel)  
ps4-linux-4.14 & 4.19 (PSXITA + Kquote's kernels)  
ps4-ucode (I think source url was broken?)  
ps4-linux-firmware

spine  
probably many more
